# Intelligent Chatbot - Prolog

This application is a chatbot that simulates a presidential candidate. The program aims to receive questions from a user or interviewer and generate responses based on those questions. The chatbot utilizes pattern matching, where the software receives input from the user and checks if the input corresponds to any predefined patterns in the application's database.

2. Navigate to the directory where the files were extracted.
3. Run the `chatbot.pl` file using SWI-Prolog.

## Usage
